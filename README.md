# 💳 AI-Powered Credit Risk Scoring System

An end-to-end machine learning system to assess loan default risk and support financial decision-making using probability-based risk scoring.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project builds a complete credit risk assessment pipeline using machine learning, transforming raw applicant data into actionable lending decisions.

Unlike traditional classification projects, this system integrates:

* Risk probability estimation
* Threshold-based decision logic
* Business-aware trade-offs (precision vs recall)
* Interactive user interface for real-time assessment

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Financial institutions must evaluate whether a loan applicant is likely to default.

Challenges include:

* Minimizing financial loss (false negatives)
* Avoiding rejection of good customers (false positives)
* Making consistent, data-driven decisions

---

## 💼 Business Impact

- Reduces loan default risk through probability-based decisioning  
- Improves consistency in credit approvals  
- Balances risk vs opportunity using threshold optimization  
- Translates ML predictions into actionable business decisions

## 🧠 Solution Approach

### 🔹 Data Processing

* Cleaned and preprocessed German credit dataset
* Handled missing values and categorical variables

### 🔹 Feature Engineering

* Created key feature:

  * **Credit per Month = Credit Amount / Duration**

  This captures repayment burden — a critical indicator of risk.

---

### 🔹 Model Development

* Evaluated multiple models:

  * Logistic Regression
  * Decision Tree
  * Random Forest
  * XGBoost

* Final Model: **XGBoost**

* Evaluation Metric: **ROC-AUC (~0.93)**

---

### 🔹 Threshold Optimization (Key Insight)

Default classification threshold (0.5) was adjusted to **0.4** to:

* Increase recall (detect more risky applicants)
* Reduce financial risk from false negatives

---

## 📊 Key Results

* ROC-AUC: **~0.93**
* Improved risk detection via threshold tuning
* Built a decision system, not just a classifier

---

## 🖥️ Interactive Dashboard

Users can:

* Input applicant details
* Get default probability
* View risk classification (High / Low)
* Receive actionable recommendation (Approve / Reject)

---

## 💼 Business Impact

* Supports data-driven loan approvals
* Reduces potential financial loss
* Improves consistency in decision-making
* Bridges ML predictions with business logic

---

## 🧠 Key Innovation: Threshold Optimization

Instead of using the default 0.5 cutoff, the threshold was reduced to **0.4** to:

- Increase recall (catch more risky applicants)
- Reduce financial loss from missed defaulters
- Align model behavior with real-world risk tolerance

This transforms the model from a classifier into a **decision system**.
